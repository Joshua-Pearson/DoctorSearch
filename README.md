<h4> This site uses an API I built that includes every doctor in a 10-mile radius of San Francisco, CA, that accepts insurance for Covered CA for the four major insurance companies in the area. Those four insurance companies are Blue Shield, Blue Cross, Kaiser and CCHP. The API was created by retrieving each doctor's information directly from the insurance companies' websites. I then allow any user to search by insurance company as well as name or specialty or medical group to populate the map using angular-google-maps API. I then use Yelp's API to allow users to see the reviews of the doctors in their area that match their search criteria. </h4>

<h4> This app is only as good as the data it uses. So if the insurance companies' directories are out of date or Yelp doesn't have reviews on certain doctors, those circumstances are outside of my control and will result in an incomplete user experience. However, the impetus behind building this app was to create an awareness of the lack of information regarding the health care industry so we can try and get better, more up to date data. </h4>


<h5> This application was built entirely in Angular, Node and Express. No database was needed as it is primarily an API calling application.</h5>

<h5> I built this app as well as the API <a>https://github.com/Joshua-Pearson/DoctorAPI</a> as my final graduating project at General Assembly, one of the best Web Development Immersive programs in San Francisco, CA.
